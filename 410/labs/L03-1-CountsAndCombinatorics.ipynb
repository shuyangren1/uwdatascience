    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is one of the biggest areas of mathematics. We apply combinatorics to compute the possible combinations or permutations of a combination of events. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use combinatorics to compute the number of possible sandwiches we can order at a sandwich shop with a limited menu: 4 bread choices, 5 meat choices, 4 toppings.  How many unique sandwich combination can we order by picking one item from each category?   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$4 * 5 * 4 = 80$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that for this problem we just need to multiple the number of choices for each class. This is an example of the **multiplication principle** of combinatorics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example there is no dependency of our choice from one category to another. Consequently, we can find all of the possible combinations by simple multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not always the case. Let's look at an example where each event changes the subsequent possible events. Let's say I go to a pub and I want to order a 4-beer taster, with each beer being unique. The pub has 10 beers on tap. How many possible choices do I have for my taster? Fortunately I know `python`, so I can use the `python` `itertools.combinations` function to build a table of all possible combinations of my 4-beer taster!"
