Review

Supervised:
	- reression: linear reg, ridge reg, k-nearest neighbor, SVR, PCR (picinipal component regression), time series, trees, ensemble models
	- classifications: logistic reg, ridge logistic reg, SVM (binary classification only), NB, trees, ensemble models
Unsupervised: k-means, PCA

unstrcutured data: raw text, images, video
semi-strectured data: json & XML
strectured data: tabular data, relational database

supervised data has labels (target, dependent, outcome) Can be either categorical or numerical.
Supervised data has features (indpendent variable, explanatory variables, predictors)

categorical features withou a lot of categories: high cardinality

Times series data: stock prices
timestamp, stock price, earning, Donald Trump tweet, ...
What are some features?
INdustry (categorical), P/E ratio (after some feature engineering), log_stock_price, kim-longtitude / latitude 
What are things that are not nesecessarily features?
tweet is just raw text

- online scoring vs batch scoring
	online: score one example at a time, common in applications
	batches: score the entire data at once

Past data: know if they showed up or not (historical data)
take historical data: divide it into training + test

future data - future applications (unlabled)
score: bbatch (nightly job)
